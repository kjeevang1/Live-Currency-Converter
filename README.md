**Live Currency Converter**

A live currency converter built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to enter an amount and convert it from one currency to another using the latest exchange rates fetched from a public API. The app features a clean design and easy-to-use interface.


**How It Works**

The app reads the amount and selected currencies from the input fields.

On clicking the "Convert" button, it calls the ExchangeRate API to get the latest exchange rate for the chosen "from" currency.

It calculates the converted amount by multiplying the entered amount with the fetched exchange rate.

The result is displayed below the button.
